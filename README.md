# Deep Learning For Computer Vision
This is a first approach to Deep Learning by an investigation group from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.
We used another team's [solution](https://github.com/thevishalagarwal/BoneAgeEstimation) to submerge ourselves. However, we've since modified it to suit our needs and to apply any improvements we saw fit.

The order of execution would be
1. pickle_dataset
2. main
3. check

Dependencies needed

* [python3](https://www.python.org/)
